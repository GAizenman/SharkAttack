	For Program 5, we created a scene in three.js. It can be run on most platforms <br/>
	and on almost any web browser, so feel free to try it out yourself! In the scene,<br/>
	there is Mr.Robot that is stranded on a wooden plank in the middle of an ocean, and<br/>
	is being circled by sharks. Want to help him out? Well too bad because we didn't<br/>
	have enough time to implement that.<br/>
	BUT you can see him from different angles! We have implemented FlyControls.js,<br/>
	so you can use the arrow keys to rotate and the WASD keys to move. You can also<br/>
	click and drag your mouse on the screen to roatate the camera. Finally, when you<br/>
	go to the controls in the top right, you can change some aspects of Mr.Robot himself!<br/>
	Have fun!<br/><br/>

	Gabriel Aizenman:<br/>
	I really enjoyed this last project. It was a great way to take all the things<br/>
	we have learned in the past quarter and see one way that it can actually be <br/>
	applied. It is obvious that three.js is much more thought out compared to webgl,<br/>
	and it was also very fun to code in because I could appreciate the work that was<br/>
	happening behind the scenes.<br/><br/>
	Cameron Taylor:<br/>
	Messing around with three.js, I learned the true potential of what we had been<br/>
  learning all year. Three.js has most of the leg work done for you, so the true challenge<br/>
	comes from knowing which functions to call and the documentation behind them. <br/>
	Also because the examples we were inspired by were open source, we were using<br/>
	concepts from different projects and using them as tools to get to our final product.<br/>
