# SharkAttack
Cameron Taylor and I created a scene in three.js. It can be run on most platforms
and on almost any web browser, so feel free to try it out yourself! In the scene,
there is Mr.Robot that is stranded on a wooden plank in the middle of an ocean, and
is being circled by sharks. Want to help him out? Well too bad because we didn't
have enough time to implement that.<br>
BUT you can see him from different angles! We have implemented FlyControls.js,
so you can use the arrow keys to rotate and the WASD keys to move. You can also
click and drag your mouse on the screen to roatate the camera. Finally, when you
go to the controls in the top right, you can change some aspects of Mr.Robot himself!
Have fun!<br>
